      <h3>About the Band</h3>
      <p>The Blind Owl Band, from Saranac Lake, NY, in the Heart of The Adirondack Mountains in Upstate NY, are expanding their ground in 2016! Since inception in September of 2010, The Blind Owl Band has forged a unique sound with their stringed instruments. A relentless approach in all they do, whether a packed touring schedule or energy packed show. Get ready, for this freight train will not stop!</p>

      <p>“Although we look like a bluegrass band we are not. We are a musical representation of what sounds float around in our heads. We use the instruments of our ancestors, but play music of our time, influenced by all that has happened in the musical world over the past 27 years. We achieve a unique personal sound through a raw instrumentation. In a time of perfection and an expansion of the realm through digital processors, we hope to inspire use of wood and metal. To take a basic approach and expanded it to a sound all its own.”</p>

      <p>In just under five years the band has released their debut album “Rabble Rousing” and it’s follow up “This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel”. Heavy regional touring has also ensued all over the North East playing over 550 shows in 17 states since the band starting regional touring in January 2012. The Blind Owl Band has also appeared at near 100 festivals during this time. This includes: The Peach Music Festival, The Susquehanna Breakdown, Jerry Jam, Backwoods Pondfest, Jibber Jazz Madsummer Meltdown, Fiddlers Picnic, The Purple Pig Music Festival, Harrys Harvest Festival, Sterling Stage and More. The Blind Owl Band has shared the stage with: Yonder Mountain String Band, Trampled By Turtles, Railroad Earth, The Hackensaw Boys, Larry and His Flask, The Rumpke Mtn. Boys, Cabinet, Driftwood, Eastbound Jesus, The Mallett Brothers and more! It has been a positive start for the Blind Owl Band. They look forward to expanding new grounds in 2015 both on the surface of the earth, and in the noise in the air! Get ready for Adirondack Freight Train String Music!
